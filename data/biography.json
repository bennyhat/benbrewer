  "biography": "I'm originally from a small, cattle ranching town called Broadus, Montana. After high school, I received my undergraduate education and worked in various technical fields in the tri-state area. I eventually left the mid-west to obtain a Master of Science degree in Electronic Engineering over in Bristol, England. When I arrived back in the states, I somehow ended up in Columbus, Ohio, where I most recently gained a position as a DevOps Artisan at Pillar Technology.",
